# x-harness-verify

Use this skill to verify a completion claim.

## Rules

- **Read-only**. Do not edit source files.
- Inspect `completion-card.yaml`.
- Inspect changed files and evidence if available.
- Run `node packages/cli/dist/index.js check --card completion-card.yaml --strict` (or `verify --strict`) in this repository.
- Return one outcome:
  - `success`
  - `failed`
  - `blocked`
  - `skipped`
  - `timeout`
  - `error`

## Admission mapping

- `success` -> `accepted`
- `failed` -> `withheld`
- `blocked` -> `withheld`
- `skipped` -> `withheld`
- `timeout` -> `withheld`
- `error` -> `withheld`

Only `success` maps to `accepted`. Everything else maps to `withheld`.

## PGV

PGV advice is advisory-only. It never overrides verify and never grants admission authority.

## Do not treat as accepted completion

- `claim.fix_status: fixed`
- `verification.status: passed`
- `pgv_advice.claim_allowed: yes`

## Stop condition

Return the verify outcome and handoff. Do not edit files to fix findings.

## Generated Adapter Contract

- Completion is admitted, not claimed.
- Verifier is read-only.
- Success is the only accepted outcome.
- Canonical tiers: light, standard, deep.
- PGV is advisory-only.

## Evidence Floor

- **light**: files_changed + (command_evidence or manual_rationale).
- **standard**: files_changed + command_evidence + done_checklist + prediction.
- **deep**: files_changed + command_evidence + evidence_scope_declared + untested_regions_declared + remaining_risks_declared + execution_controls_present + rollback_policy_present + done_checklist + prediction. Runtime-enforced: verification_artifacts, state.read_set, state.write_set.

## Strict Evidence Provenance

- verify --strict requires command_evidence entries to include command, exit_code, runner, and started_at for standard/deep cards.
- verify --strict requires verification_artifacts entries to include command, exit_code, runner, and started_at for standard/deep cards.
